                        <p class="draw-txt">This drawing is an example of an isometric drawing, which shows a three-dimensional object on a two-dimensional surface. It demonstrates proper use of lines, angles, and measurements to create a clear and accurate 3D form. The structure looks like a set of steps or blocks, symbolizing progress and development — each level representing growth in skills and knowledge. This work reflects precision, patience, and attention to detail, which are essential qualities in technical and engineering drawing.</p>

                            <p class="draw-txt">This is a mechanical or orthographic drawing, showing the front and top views of a 3D object with accurate measurements. It demonstrates the importance of precision, scale, and technical understanding in creating engineering designs. The drawing reflects your ability to interpret and represent real objects in detailed views, which is essential in fields like drafting, architecture, and engineering. It also shows discipline and accuracy the key skills needed to produce professional and functional technical plans.</p>

                                        <p>This drawing, created during my Grade 12 year in the subject Contemporary Philippine Arts from the Regions (CPAR), is titled “Born to Be Filipino.” It represents my pride and love for the Philippines. The Mayon Volcano symbolizes the beauty and strength of our country, while the bell tower reflects our rich history and cultural heritage. Through this artwork, I wanted to express that being Filipino is something to be proud of it means being resilient, creative, and deeply connected to our land and traditions.</p>

                                            <p>This artwork, titled “Independence of the Filipino,” was created during my Grade 12 year in Contemporary Philippine Arts from the Regions (CPAR). It shows a Filipino soldier raising the national flag, symbolizing courage, freedom, and patriotism. The glowing background and waving flags represent hope and pride for our nation’s independence. Through this piece, I wanted to honor the sacrifices of our heroes and remind everyone that being free is a privilege we must value and protect as Filipinos.</p>
