                        <p class="auto-txt">Through my studies in the Automotive subject, I have gained a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles that make vehicles function efficiently and safely. This subject has provided me with valuable knowledge about the different automotive systems such as the engine, transmission, suspension, braking, and electrical systems. I learned how each component works together to ensure the proper performance of a vehicle. The lessons and hands-on activities allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations, such as performing basic maintenance, diagnosing mechanical issues, and using the proper tools and equipment safely. Moreover, this subject taught me the importance of safety, discipline, and attention to detail in every task performed. I realized that working in the automotive field requires not only technical expertise but also patience, precision, and responsibility. Every repair or inspection affects the safety and reliability of a vehicle, which in turn impacts the lives of its users. Therefore, professionalism and ethical practices are essential qualities that every automotive technician must possess. Another significant lesson I learned is the value of continuous learning and technological adaptation. As modern vehicles become more advanced with computerized and electric systems, it is important for automotive professionals to stay updated with the latest innovations and diagnostic tools. This inspired me to keep improving my knowledge and skills to meet the demands of the ever-evolving automotive industry.</p>
